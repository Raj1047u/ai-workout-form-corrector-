# Create deployment guide
deployment_guide = '''# AI Workout Form Corrector - Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: System Requirements Check
```bash
# Verify Python version (3.9+ required)
python --version

# Check camera access
# Run test script after installation
python test_system.py
```

### Step 2: Installation
```bash
# Basic installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Full ML installation (recommended)
pip install -r requirements_full.txt

# Run setup script
python setup.py
```

### Step 3: Launch Application
```bash
# Basic version (lightweight)
python ai_workout_form_corrector.py

# ML-enhanced version (full features)
python ai_workout_form_corrector_ml.py
```

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup

#### Windows
```cmd
# Install Python 3.9+ from python.org
# Open Command Prompt
cd path\\to\\project
pip install -r requirements_full.txt
python ai_workout_form_corrector_ml.py
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install python@3.9
pip3 install -r requirements_full.txt
python3 ai_workout_form_corrector_ml.py
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9 python3-pip python3-tk
pip3 install -r requirements_full.txt
python3 ai_workout_form_corrector_ml.py
```

### Camera Setup

1. **Position**: 3-6 feet from camera
2. **Lighting**: Ensure adequate, even lighting
3. **Background**: Minimal clutter, contrasting background
4. **View**: For squats/lunges use side view; push-ups can use angle view

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better FPS
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use good lighting conditions
- Position camera at eye level
- Ensure stable internet (if using cloud features)

#### For Better Accuracy
- Wear contrasting clothing
- Ensure full body visible
- Maintain consistent lighting
- Use recommended camera angles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Camera not accessible"
```bash
# Check camera permissions
# Windows: Settings > Privacy > Camera
# macOS: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Camera
# Linux: Check /dev/video* permissions
```

#### "MediaPipe import failed"
```bash
# Reinstall MediaPipe
pip uninstall mediapipe
pip install mediapipe==0.8.11
```

#### Low FPS Performance
```bash
# Reduce video resolution in config.json
# Close other camera applications
# Update graphics drivers
```

#### ML Model Errors
```bash
# Reinstall scikit-learn
pip uninstall scikit-learn
pip install scikit-learn==1.0.2
```
