# Let me analyze the project files to understand the requirements for creating the AI Workout Form Corrector app

# Based on the comprehensive documentation provided, I can see this is a detailed AI Workout Form Corrector project
# that uses computer vision and machine learning for real-time exercise form analysis

# Key components from the documentation:
# 1. Uses MediaPipe Pose for real-time pose estimation (33 landmarks)
# 2. Implements geometric rule-based analysis for squats, push-ups, and lunges
# 3. Provides real-time feedback and form-gated repetition counting
# 4. Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, and Tkinter
# 5. Achieves 24-28 FPS on consumer hardware

# Let me create a comprehensive implementation based on the specifications
